<p>
    This example shows how to configure Telerik TreeView for ASP.NET MVC to load its
    nodes through Ajax requests. The request is performed only once. After that the
    content is rendered on the page and treeview shows/hides it without performing additional
    requests.
</p>
<p>
    You can bind the treeview to an ActionMethod that will get requested through AJAX,
    or to an ASMX / WCF web service, using the <strong>DataBinding</strong> method.
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;%= Html.Telerik().TreeView()
     .Name("TreeView")
     <em>.DataBinding(dataBinding => dataBinding
         .Ajax().Select("_AjaxLoading", "TreeView")
     )</em>
 %&gt;
</pre>
<p>
    You can load the whole treeview from scratch, or load the initially visible nodes
    using the BindTo method, like the root node in this example.</p>
