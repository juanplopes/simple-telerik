<p>You can achieve unprecedented performance for your web application with the lightweight, semantically rendered Extensions that completely leverage the ASP.NET MVC model of no postbacks, no ViewState, and no page life cycle. Additional performance gains are delivered through the Extensions’ Web Asset Managers, which enable you to optimize the delivery of CSS and JavaScript to your pages. You combine, cache, and compress resources resulting in fewer requests that your page must make to load, improving page load time performance. </p>
